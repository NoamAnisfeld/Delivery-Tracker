# Delivery Tracker

Live on https://noamanisfeld.github.io/Delivery-Tracker

This app allows keeping track of your online purcashes delivery.

Whenever you order a product, go to the app and add it, filling the name of the product in, along with the store, the price, and the estimated delivery date.

Your orders would be displayed sorted by their estimated arrive date (with late deliveries marked in red and deliveries estimated for today marked in green). Once a product arrives, send it to the list of archived items, which can be displayed separately.

In addition, you can display a summary of all your purcashes and outcomes, grouped by their store.
